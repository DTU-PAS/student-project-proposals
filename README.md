# Student project proposals
In this repository, staff from the *[Automation and Control Group, Department for Photonics and Electrical Engineering](https://electro.dtu.dk/research/research-areas/electro-technology/automation-og-control)* is providing a collection of project proposals that can be considered for special courses, bachelor projects or master projects.


Each pdf-document corresponds to one project, containing a short **description**, a **required level** as well as **contact** information. In case you are interested in the project, please contact the responsible for further details!

Here is the list of the projects:
